SGAS LUTS3 server (accounting server).


An SGAS accounting system consist of two parts:

* The SGAS LUTS, which is used for storing usage records, and
  extracting usage data from. See docs/server-setup for more information.

* A logger. This is typically a plugin for a grid middleware. The arc-ur-logger
  and arc-ur-registrant from ARC 0.8.1 or newer is recommended as a baseline for
  starting.

  There is also a small seperate client in the module called luts3-client.


Install:

$ python setup sdist
Will create a tarball suitable for distrubution in the dist/ directory.
See docs/server-setup for further instructions.
