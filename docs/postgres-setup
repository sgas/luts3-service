This document covers setting up PostgreSQL as a backend for SGAS.


1. Install PostgreSQL, PostgreSQL Contrib, and Psycopg2 (PostgreSQL Python
client)

In Debian / Ubuntu:

$ sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib python-psycopg2


2. Setup Database:

# these steps should be done as the postgres system user

# Enable some adminstrative things, needed for pgadmin3
$ psql -U postgres -d postgres < /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/contrib/adminpack.sql

# create the database, user, and schema
$ createdb sgas
$ createlang plpgsql sgas

# Note: the following commands MUST be done by the SGAS database user,
# not the postgresql administrative user.
$ psql sgas
sgas=# CREATE USER root PASSWORD 'db-password';
sgas=# \i /usr/local/share/sgas/postgres/sgas-postgres-schema.sql
sgas=# \q

# please remember use another password


3. Optimizations

None of these steps are necessary, but are provided as an easy way to solve
some performance problems. Note that setting these settings without having
performance problems will just result in PostgreSQL using more memory.

The following parameters should be set in the postgresql.conf file, typically
located at: /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf or similar.

Parameters:

work_mem=16MB           # good if performing large GROUP BY statements
                        # even higher,e.g., 64-128 MB can be good.

shared_buffers = 64MB   # this is essentially disk cache, good if you have
                        # I/O problems. Note that for setting it higher
                        # than 28-30 MB requires changing a kernel/sysctl
                        # parameter.
