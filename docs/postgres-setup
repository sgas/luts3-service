This document covers setting up PostgreSQL as a backend for SGAS.


1. Install PostgreSQL, PostgreSQL Contrib, and Psycopg2 (PostgreSQL Python
client)

Note: Only PostgreSQL version 8.4 or later is supported, but the schema might
work with earlier versions (should work with 8.3).

In Debian / Ubuntu:

$ sudo apt-get install postgresql python3-psycopg2


2. Setup Database:

# these steps should be done as the postgres system user

# Enable some adminstrative things, needed for pgadmin3
$ psql -U postgres -d postgres < /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/contrib/adminpack.sql

# create the database, user, and schema
$ createdb sgas
$ createlang plpgsql sgas

# create user, please remember to use another password
$ psql sgas
sgas=# CREATE USER root PASSWORD 'db-password';

# Add extension btree_gist
sgas=# CREATE EXTENSION btree_gist;

# Note: The following commands MUST be done by the SGAS database user,
#       NOT the postgresql administrative user.
sgas=# \i /usr/local/share/sgas/postgres/sgas-postgres-schema.sql
sgas=# \i /usr/local/share/sgas/postgres/sgas-postgres-view.sql
sgas=# \i /usr/local/share/sgas/postgres/sgas-postgres-functions.sql
sgas=# \q



3. Optimizations

None of these steps are necessary, but are provided as an easy way to solve
some performance problems. Note that setting these settings without having
performance problems will just result in PostgreSQL using more memory.

The following parameters should be set in the postgresql.conf file, typically
located at: /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf or similar.

Parameters:

work_mem=16MB           # good if performing large GROUP BY statements
                        # even higher,e.g., 64-128 MB can be good.

shared_buffers = 64MB   # this is essentially disk cache, good if you have
                        # I/O problems. Note that for setting it higher
                        # than 28-30 MB requires changing a kernel/sysctl
                        # parameter.
