=== Storage Accounting ===

As of 3.6.0, SGAS LUTS supports storage accounting using the EMI StAR record
format (v7). Note that the format is not yet finalized, and the implementation
may therefore be subject to changes.

A copy of the EMI StAR format specification can be retrieved from the project
page: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/EMI/StorageAccounting

The setup for storage accounting is quite similar to usage records. A client
must be create the storage records to be produced and write them into an SGAS
spool directory. The directory should have the following format:

sgasspool
 |- archive     # registered records are transferred to here
 |- records     # new records should be written here
 |- state       # used for storing persistent information about registrations

When written, the records must be registered with a client. Such a client is
distributed in the LUTS3 client (sgas-sr-registrant). See the client for
documentation on using the client.

If working directly with SGAS, the URL for the storage record resource is
(typically) /sgas/sr.
