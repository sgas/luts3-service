As of version 3.3, SGAS features a small, but quite usefull view engine. The
view engine is capable of visualizing information in browsers, using graphs and
tables.

This document explains how to setup the views, and what the view engine is
capable of.


The SGAS view frontpage is found at the URL path /sgas/view, e.g.,:
https://host.example.org:6443/sgas/view. Here there are links to view, which
are defined in sgas.conf.


A basic view example follows:

[view:insert_total]
type=bars
description=Total Inserts, Last 150 days
query=SELECT insert_time, sum(n_jobs) FROM uraggregated \
      WHERE insert_time > current_date - interval '150 days' GROUP BY insert_time ORDER BY insert_time;

Here the view name is "insert_total", and is a standard bar chart. A
description is made, and query to the database is specified (note that it is
possible to have long entries split across several lines by using \). They
query is stock SQL, and is send to the database as is. This provides great
freedom for information retrieval.

By default SGAS will display both an HTML table with the results and a
visualize the data in graph using javascript. Note that a faily new browser is
needed. For large series of data, the table rendering is disabled, as large
tables are usually rather useless. It is however possible to force rendering of
it, by setting "drawtable=true", or disabling explicitely by setting
"drawtable=false". The same goes for the graph, e.g., "drawgraph=false". By
default the graph is always rendered.

For rendering bar charts the result of the query should be keyed and
one-dimensional, i.e., the rows returned should be of length 2, with the first
entry being the key, and the second the value. The key should be unique, or
strange things will happen (typically one should do a GROUP BY statement).
Besides bar charts, stacked bar charts is also supported. For such charts, data
should be keyed two-dimensional. I.e., a row should be of length 3, with the
first two values being the "key" and the third value the actual value. The
first value is the column. An example of query for a stacked bar is:

    SELECT execution_time, machine_name, sum(walltime) FROM uraggregated \
    WHERE execution_time > (current_date - interval '10 days') GROUP BY execution_time, machine_name;

Which will display the walltime used by each machine over the last ten days.

Authorization can specified per view or an all-access pass can be granted. To
grant access to a specific view, make an in sgas.authz similar to this:

    "/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=ndgf.org/CN=Henrik Thostrup Jensen"     view:inserts

It is also possible to specify multiple views by comma seperating them, e.g.,:

    "/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=ndgf.org/CN=Henrik Thostrup Jensen"     view:inserts,view:vo_walltime

To grant a person access to all views, just specify view, e.g.:

    "/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=ndgf.org/CN=Josva Kleist"               view


Note that SGAS must be restarted in order for any configuration or
authorization changes to take place.

Hopefully this guide can get you started. Remember that you can use the psql
shell to play around with queries before using them in views.

Finally here are some more view examples:

[view:executed_total]
type=bars
description=Total Job Walltime Days, Last 50 days
query=SELECT execution_time, (sum(walltime) / 24.0)::integer FROM uraggregated \
      WHERE execution_time > current_date - interval '50 days' GROUP BY execution_time ORDER BY execution_time;

[view:vo_walltime]
type=stacked_bars
description=Aggregated walltime days per VO
query=SELECT execution_time, COALESCE(vo_name, 'N/A'), (sum(walltime) / 24.0)::integer FROM uraggregated \
      WHERE execution_time > (current_date - interval '200 days') GROUP BY execution_time, COALESCE(vo_name, 'N/A');
