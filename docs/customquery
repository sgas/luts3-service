=== SGAS Custom Query Engine ===

As of version 3.6.X, SGAS LUTS features a small, but usefull custom query engine. 
However queries had to be manually defined.

The custom query engine is capable of generating JSON lists from standard 
SQL queries and passing arguments to the query using url-arguments.

The SGAS custom query interface is found at the URL path /sgas/customquery,
e.g.,: https://host.example.org:6443/sgas/customquery. 

== Custom queries ==

Custom queries can report arbitraty data from the database.
The cost of this flexibility, is complexity in defining the query, 
which is done in the configure file.

* Short overview of all configuration options:

Option              Descrpition

querygroup      Comma seperated list of groups which can access the query.
query           The query send to the database for data retrieval.
params			Comma seperated list of required params in query. 
                

* Explanatory, In-depth Custom Query Configuration

[query:lastinsert]
querygroup=admin,nagios
query=SELECT machine_name,max(generate_time) as updated \
      FROM uraggregated GROUP BY machine_name

Here the query name is "lastinsert", and are in the query groups admin and nagios
(comma seperated list). The querygroup is used for authorization, will be
explained later. The query will return a list of machine_name and last time the 
machine got any data inserted (note that it is possible to have long
entries split across several lines by using \). They query is stock SQL, and is
send to the database as is. This provides great freedom for information
retrieval.

Each row of the result will be presented as a hash table with the 
column name as key for easy reading and usage of the data.

The result of this query will look something like this:

[
    {
        "updated": "2012-06-01 13:35:17.092364",
        "machine_name": "hostname.example.com"
    },
    {
        "updated": "2012-06-01 13:01:22.386829",
        "machine_name": "cluster.example.com"
    },
    {
        "updated": "2012-01-14 00:37:21.252743",
        "machine_name": "grid.example.com"
    }
]

An URL for this query might look like:

https://host.example.org:6443/sgas/customquery/lastinsert


* Parameters in the query

[query:lastinsert-machine]
querygroup=admin,nagios
query=SELECT machine_name,max(generate_time) as updated \
      FROM uraggregated where machine_name = <<machine_name>> GROUP BY machine_name
params=machine_name

In this example we only query for one specific machine ("machine_name").
The URL param of "machine_name" is replaced with the occurance of <<machine_name>>
in the SQL query.

An URL for this query might look like:

https://host.example.org:6443/sgas/customquery/lastinsert-machine?machine_name=hostname.example.com


* Authorization

Authorization can specified per query or an all-access pass can be granted. To
grant access to a specific query, make an in sgas.authz similar to this:

    "/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=ndgf.org/CN=Henrik Thostrup Jensen"     customquery:query=lastinsert

To specify two (or more) queries at once do like this:

    "/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=ndgf.org/CN=Henrik Thostrup Jensen"     customquery:query=lastinsert+query=lastinsert-machine

To specify access rights to a query group:

    "/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=ndgf.org/CN=Henrik Thostrup Jensen"     customquery:querygroup=nagios

It is also possible to specify multiple queries/groups by comma seperating the entries:

    "/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=ndgf.org/CN=Henrik Thostrup Jensen"     customquery:query=lastinsert-machine,customquery:querygroup=admin
    
To grant a person access to all queries, just specify query or query:all, e.g.:

    "/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=ndgf.org/CN=Josva Kleist"               query:all

Note that SGAS must be restarted in order for any configuration or
authorization changes to take place.


* Index in the database

Please note that for some queries index in the database might be needed and/or required for good performance.

More index might also slow down the process of creating new records. Use with care wheres needed.

More information about index are available at http://www.postgresql.org/ in the documentation for your current version.


* Example query

[query:lastinsert-machine]
querygroup=admin,nagios
query=SELECT machine_name,max(generate_time) as updated \
      FROM uraggregated where machine_name = <<machine_name>> GROUP BY machine_name
params=machine_name

URL: https://host.example.org:6443/sgas/customquery/lastinsert-machine?machine_name=hostname.example.com


[query:lastinsert]
querygroup=admin,nagios
query=SELECT machine_name,max(generate_time) as updated \
      FROM uraggregated GROUP BY machine_name
