=== SGAS LUTS Installation Documentation ===

The LUTS service stores usage records in an underlaying database, and provides
a mechanism for retrieving aggregated information from these.


== Requirements ==

* Python 2.6 (2.5 will probably work, but is not well tested)
* Twisted Core and Web (http://twistedmatrix.com/)
* NginX 0.7.66 / 0.8.51 or later (http://nginx.org/)
* PostgreSQL 8.4 as backend database (8.3 should work as well)

For Python 2.5 you will need the simplejson module.

Debian/Ubuntu packages: python-twisted python-twisted-web nginx

RedHat / CentOS packages: ?

Old distributions:

Typically the Python version is not new enough (Python 2.6 is recommended, 2.4
will NOT work, 2.5 should work), Python and will have to be installed manually
with dependencies. See the old-distro-notes file for guides.


== Database ==

SGAS uses PostgreSQL for storing usage data. See docs/postgres-setup for
PostgreSQL setup.

CouchDB is no longer supported.


== NginX ==

As of version 3.5, SGAS requires a reverse proxy in front of it for TLS/SSL
handling and serving static files. NginX is the supported reverse proxy, and
SGAS comes with (almost) ready configuration files for this. It should be
possible to use other reverse proxies, but then you are on your own.

See docs/nginx-setup for how to setup NginX.


== Installation & Configuration ==

1. Unpack the tarball (you have probably already done this)
2. Run: python setup.py build
3. Run: sudo python setup.py install

Relocation can be done by using --home in the install step.

Edit /etc/sgas.conf, the main settings you should worry about is

db=..   (the database connection information)
user=.. (the user which SGAS should run as)

If you relocated SGAS, you may need to set

authzfile=..    (SGAS authorization file)

You also need to define which plugins to use. See the plugins documentation
for more information.
 

Hereafter edit sgas.authz to set which identities can perform which actions.
Subject names must in "", so a line would look like this:

"/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/CN=host/host.example.org"      insert

Which will allow the host to insert usage records. You will probably need to
define several of these.

Per default the last two parts of the host name, has to match the last two
parts of the machine name in the records registered. E.g., the above identity,
can insert for cluster.example.org, but not "cluster.othersite.org" (the depth
of the check can be controlled via the check_depth option). To allow a site to
insert for a specific host name, the following can be used:

"/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/CN=host/host.example.org"      insert:machine_name=host.example.org

Or just allow inserting for all hosts:

"/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/CN=host/host.example.org"      insert:all

Typically having host identities and "insert" works just fine, but there are
cases where the two previous are needed.

Furthermore it is possible to define views (and access to these), as well as
access to the SGAS query interface. See docs/views and docs/query-interface.
